### Geography

I live in Portugal

### Reading

Three books I recommend are:

- *Crime and Punishment* by Fyodor Dostoevsky
- *The Master and Margarita* by Mikhail Bulgakov 
- *Le Petit Prince* by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

### Food

If you haven't tried out portuguese plates, I recommend the following:

1. Francesinha. A snack made in Porto.
2. Polvo à Laguareiro. Octopus with boiled potatoes taken to the oven cooked in olive oil
3. Bacalhau à Brás. Cod with fried potatoes.

### Thoughts

I should try to do more stuff and get out more, this GitHub thing is amazing.
